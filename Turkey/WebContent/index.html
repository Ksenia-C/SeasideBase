			<h2>Seaside Base</h2>
			<div class="block_cell">
				<p>This website was made for the organization of information.
					Are you an organizer of some repeating event and would like to see
					statistics of participations? Or are you school teacher and would
					like to find out in what school activities your students are
					involved? Then this site can help you by keep statistics.</p>

				<p>It can collect data from csv tables, creating one common base
					for every person and every event and participation.</p>
				<p>So, how to work with the site? Tables can be loaded to the
					site in the section "add table". The section "for people" is for
					tables with information about persons. There can be name, surname,
					degree or number of group and some other common data. It supposes
					that every person can be identified with a low probability of
					repetitions by Name, Surname, Date of Birth, City and maybe
					Patronymic.</p>

				<p>The section "with event" is for tables with some results or
					preparations for the events. Form of registration or scores for
					tasks. You also may state in what columns of table what main
					information about human is, so to try to find participators from
					base.</p>

				<p>To search among people you need to open the section "make
					request/about people". The same for events is in the "make request/
					about events". To see all the added items, don't fill any fields.
					One-click on the string leads to the page of item (person or
					event). On that page, all the information about it and data can be
					changed.</p>
